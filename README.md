This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in React Router DOM v6 where unexpected values are passed to the `element` prop of the `Route` component.  The error typically arises from conditional rendering or typos in component imports. The solution provides a robust approach to handle these scenarios, ensuring the application gracefully handles edge cases and prevents runtime errors.
