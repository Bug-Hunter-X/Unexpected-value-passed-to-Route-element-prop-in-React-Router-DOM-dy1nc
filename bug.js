```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App; 

```
This code produces an error because the `element` prop in `Route` should be a React component, but in some cases it could be passed a value that is not a valid component. For instance, if the component is conditionally rendered and the condition evaluates to false, it might result in `null` being passed to `element`, causing a runtime error.

Another problem can be caused if there is a typo or a problem importing the components used in the `Route` elements.
