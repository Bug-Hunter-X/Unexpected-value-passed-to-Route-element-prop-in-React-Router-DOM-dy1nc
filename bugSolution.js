```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  const Home = () => <h1>Home</h1>;
  const About = () => <h1>About</h1>;
  const Contact = () => <h1>Contact</h1>;
  const NotFound = () => <h1>404 Not Found</h1>;

  const shouldRenderAbout = true;

  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route
          path="/about"
          element={shouldRenderAbout ? <About /> : <Navigate to="/" />}
        />
        <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```
This solution uses conditional rendering with `Navigate` to redirect to a safe route (Home in this case) if `About` is not available.  It also includes a catch-all route (`path="*"`) for handling unknown paths preventing errors.  Thorough error checking during component import is also essential to prevent typos from causing unexpected behavior.
